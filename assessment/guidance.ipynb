    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some of the most common pitfalls past students have encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Not carefully following the assessment instructions, marking scheme, and advice. Students often miss key requirements by skimming the documentation. We strongly recommend you re-read the assessment instructions and any related guidelines several times throughout the assessment period.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Leaving most of the work until the end. This assessment is designed for steady, consistent progress. Leaving work until the last minute is not a good idea, as regular Git commits and problem solving are part of the assessment. While some students feel they should be allowed to complete the assessment as they see fit, this assessment is based on standard professional practice: companies expect steady, version-controlled progress. You need something to show at any stage during the assessment time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Untidy work. Some students forget to structure their repositories properly. They lose marks for simple, easy-to-fix issues. This includes typos and grammatical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Submitting notebooks or code without explanations. Your work must include clear comments, markdown explanations, and other documentation to show your understanding. Code alone is not enough. Likewise, code needs to be broken down into small code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Taking another student's word for it. Don't rely on another student's understanding of the assessment requirements. It's up to you to cover the module and assessment materials. If you are unsure of something, ask the lecturer. It's not fair on the other student as it's your responsibility to complete the assessment correctly."

    "   - `Repository name`: Use a meaningful name (e.g., the module name).\n",
    "     Ensure the name contains only lowercase letters, underscores, or hyphens (no spaces).\n",

    "   - From the `Add .gitignore` dropdown, select `Python`.\n",
    "   - Leave the `Add license` option as `No license`, unless you want to add one.\n",
    "5. Click `Create repository` and you will be redirected to your newly created repository.\n",
    "6. Copy the URL of your repository from your browser’s address bar.\n",
    "   It should look like this:  \n",
    "   `https://github.com/username/reponame`.\n",
    "7. Paste this URL into the submission form linked in the [assessment instructions](assessment.md#submission).\n"
