    "## Problem 3 – Padding\n",

    "Author: Michael Ferry  \n",
    "Date: November 2025\n",

    "This problem looks at how SHA-256 prepares messages before hashing.  \n",
    "According to the Secure Hash Standard (FIPS PUB 180-4), every message must be\n",
    "padded so that it becomes a sequence of **512-bit blocks**.  \n",
    "This involves adding a `1` bit, filling the rest with `0`s, and placing the\n",
    "64-bit length of the original message at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a generator function `block_parse(msg)` that accepts a bytes object.\n",
    "2. Apply SHA-256 padding rules from Sections 5.1.1 and 5.2.1.\n",
    "3. Ensure that the final block (or final two blocks) contain the correct padding.\n",
    "4. Yield each 512-bit (64-byte) block as a bytes object.\n",
    "5. Test the generator with messages of different sizes to confirm everything works.\n"
